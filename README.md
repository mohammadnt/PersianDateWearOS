# Where am I? Complication for Wear OS

This is a simple app that shows a complication on the watchface which tells you the current address
you are at according to your GPS. It uses the Google Maps API to reverse-geocode your location to
display a human-readable address.

Useful for smartwatch users who are blind or vision-impaired who would like to get their bearings
quickly.
